        <p><b>About me</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <br>I am a graphic design senior at Umass Dartmouth. 
          Originally born in Massachusetts, I expanded my horizons by 
          attending Pace University in NYC for two years. There I studied film and had a good two years, 
          but the city proved too busy for me, and film was not as fulfilling as I had hoped.
          So I packed up and transferred to Umass Dartmouth where I discovered my passion for graphic design.
          I am working towards becoming a package designer and loving every step of the journey.
